The main motivation for developing this code is to apply the theoretical knowledge of Recurrent Neural Networks we gained during this class, to a real world problem. Our task was to analyze a set of simulated particle collision data containing features characterizing events detected by ATLAS (a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN).

The objective of the analysis was to classify events as either a signal, indicating the tau tau Decay of a Higgs boson, or background noise. Recurrent Neural Networks are used to formulate the classification model.
